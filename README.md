# Function calling with Google Gemini chat AI

## Function calling enables developers to incorporte custom functions or APIs with a generative AI chat application

### The AI model decides if any of the functions and APIs is useful for answering the user query, and the AI model responds with the functions and their arguments to be used

### The functions need to be well described with the arguments, their argument data types and the returning values

### In this tutorial we will explore parallel function calling with Python, using Google Gemini AI, with external APIs providing city's population and country's currency used, for answering user questions
